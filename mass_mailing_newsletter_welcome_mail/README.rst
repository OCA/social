This module was written to extend the functionality of the website popup
newsletter subscription form to support sending to new subscribers an
automatic welcome email and allow you to customize it.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Email Marketing > Mailing Lists > Mailing Lists*.
#. Edit or create one.
#. Set a *Welcome mail template* to enable this module's special behavior when
   somebody subscribes to this mailing list. You can use one shipped with
   this module, called *Welcome mail to newsletter subscribers*,
   as a starting point.
#. You can also customize this template as you prefer.

To be used, you also must make sure a subscription snippet for this list exists
somewhere in your website:

#. Go to your website.
#. Navigate to a page where you want to include the subscription widget.
#. *Edit* the webpage.
#. Drag and drop any *Structure* or *Features* block you like.
#. Drag and drop the *Inner content > Newsletter* block inside it.
#. Choose the same mailing list you configured above.

Of course, outgoing mail must be properly configured in your instance, or
emails will never be sent.

Usage
=====

After you have followed the configuration instructions:

#. Enter as an anonymous user (you can use a browser private window for that).
#. Navigate to the page where the newsletter subscription snippet is found.
#. Enter your email.
#. Hit *Subscribe*.
#. Check your inbox, you have new mail!

Known issues / Roadmap
