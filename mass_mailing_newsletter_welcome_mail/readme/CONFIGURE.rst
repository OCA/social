To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Email Marketing > Mailing Lists > Mailing Lists*.
#. Edit or create one.
#. Set a *Welcome mail template* to enable this module's special behavior when
   somebody subscribes to this mailing list. You can use one shipped with
   this module, called *Welcome mail to newsletter subscribers*,
   as a starting point.
#. You can also customize this template as you prefer.

To be used, you also must make sure a subscription snippet for this list exists
somewhere in your website:

#. Go to your website.
#. Navigate to a page where you want to include the subscription widget.
#. *Edit* the webpage.
#. Drag and drop any *Structure* or *Features* block you like.
#. Drag and drop the *Inner content > Newsletter* block inside it.
#. Choose the same mailing list you configured above.

Of course, outgoing mail must be properly configured in your instance, or
emails will never be sent.
