To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to **Settings > Technical > Automation > Automated actions > Welcome mail to New subscribers in Nesletter Mailing List** and edit anything there.

Quicker way to just change the email template (something that most likely you
will want to do):

#. Go to **Settings > Technical > Email > Templates**
#. Edit the template called **Welcome mail - Newsletter Mailing List**.
