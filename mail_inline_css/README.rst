===============
Mail Inline CSS
===============

When you send HTML emails you can't use style tags but instead you have
to put inline ``style`` attributes on every element. So from this:

.. code:: html

    <html>
    <style type="text/css">
    h1 { border:1px solid black }
    p { color:red;}
    </style>
    <h1 style="font-weight:bolder">Peter</h1>
    <p>Hej</p>
    </html>

You want this:

.. code:: html

    <html>
    <h1 style="font-weight:bolder; border:1px solid black">Peter</h1>
    <p style="color:red">Hej</p>
    </html>

This module use premailer library to do this. 

It parses an HTML page, looks up ``style`` blocks
and parses the CSS. It then uses the ``lxml.html`` parser to modify the
DOM tree of the page accordingly.

Note:

  Odoo with module web_editor already implements this feature on the client side (js).
  This module brings this server side feature for cases without js part. It could the more stable way over the Odoo versions with a stable api in a dedicated library 
  with adhoc python unit tests.
