=========================
Edit QWeb email templates
=========================

This module was written to make Odoo's WYSIWYG email template editor usable for email templates using the QWeb rendering engine.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. click the 'Edit template' button on an email template
#. note that the editor supports designing and translating your templates, but for variable substitutions et al, you'll need to edit the source code of the template

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* the editor has problems with complex template inheritance, this seems rather a problem in Odoo generally than with this specific module
