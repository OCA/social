This module links mailing.contacts with res.partners.

The same mailing.contact can be linked to multiple partners, if they
share the same email address.

This module is different than `mass_mailing_partner` because the relationship
is in the opposite direction.

It's recommended to use it with `mass_mailing_unique` module.
