To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Email Marketing > Mailings*, and create one.
#. Select as recipients a mailing list.
#. On "Select mailing lists:", choose one mailing list with dynamic flag
   checked.
#. Before sending the mass mailing, the list will be synced for having latest
   changes.

When you hit the *Sync now* button or send a mass mailing to this list, its
contacts will be automatically updated.

Pay attention to the messages shown to you that tell you about some non-obvious
behaviour you could experience if you edit manually contacts from a dynamic
list.
