The purpose of this module is to help development of email templates
allowing to render the full layout preview of each of them.

Odoo already allows you do preview emails but they are wrapped into Odoo
backend theme.

NOTE: to make work properly your emails it's strongly recommended to use
mail_inline_css to include all styles in the body of the email.
