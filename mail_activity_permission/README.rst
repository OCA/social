This module allows to manage exceptional access to records via activities.

It is meant for situations where users need access to some record that according to the permissions shouldn't be accessible, but it's also not feasible to change the global permission model.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to an activity type
#. Check the flag ``Bypass reading restrictions`` and if you need that too, ``Bypass writing restrictions``
#. From now on, records with this activity type will always be accessible for the user they are assigned to
#. If you want to execute an action when the activity is marked as done, you can fill in code in the ``Code done`` field
#. If you want to bulk assign users in an automated fashion for this activity, you can fill in code in the ``Assign users from code`` field

Usage
=====

To use this module, assign an activity with an activity type that has set the read permission flag to a user
for a record the user doesn't have access to. With the activity, the user can access it.

You can also bulk assign activities via Actions/Bulk assign activity, which you can use to make multiple records
accessible to multiple users at once. Note that if you assign activities to multiple users, they will all be
marked as done when the first user marks the activity as done.

If you want to keep access when activities are done, install `mail_activity_done`.
