To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to an activity type
#. Check the flag ``Bypass reading restrictions`` and if you need that too, ``Bypass writing restrictions``
#. From now on, records with this activity type will always be accessible for the user they are assigned to
#. If you want to execute an action when the activity is marked as done, you can fill in code in the ``Code done`` field
#. If you want to bulk assign users in an automated fashion for this activity, you can fill in code in the ``Assign users from code`` field
