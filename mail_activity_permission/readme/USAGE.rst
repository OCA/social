To use this module, assign an activity with an activity type that has set the read permission flag to a user
for a record the user doesn't have access to. With the activity, the user can access it.

You can also bulk assign activities via Actions/Bulk assign activity, which you can use to make multiple records
accessible to multiple users at once. Note that if you assign activities to multiple users, they will all be
marked as done when the first user marks the activity as done.

If you want to keep access when activities are done, install `mail_activity_done`.
