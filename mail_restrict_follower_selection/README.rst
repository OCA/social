Restrict follower selection
===========================

This module was written to allow you to restrict the selection of possible followers. For example, if you use the social ERP functions only internally, it makes sense to filter possible followers for being employees. Otherwise, you'll get a quite crowded list of partners to choose from.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to `System parameters` and adjust `mail_restrict_follower_selection.domain` as you see fit. This restricts followers globally, if you want to restrict only the followers for a certain record type (or have different restrictions for different record types), create a parameter `mail_restrict_follower_selection.domain.$your_model`.

As an example, you could use `[('customer', '=', True)]` to allow only customers to be added as follower - this also is the default.

Note: This module won't change existing followers!
