This module was written to allow you to restrict the selection of
possible followers. For example, if you use the social ERP functions
only internally, it makes sense to filter possible followers for being
employees. Otherwise, you'll get a quite crowded list of partners to
choose from.

Moreover, the module disables the option to automatically add followers
that do not meet the domain.
