Odoo native does not support defining a Cc field in the Mail Composer by
default; instead, it only has a unique Recipients fields, which is
confusing for a lot of end users.

This module allows to properly separate To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields in the
Mail Composer.

Features
--------

-  Add Cc and Bcc fields to mail composer form. Send only once to
   multiple email addresses.
-  Add Cc and Bcc fields to company form to use them as default in mail
   composer form.
-  Add Bcc field to mail template form. Use Cc and Bcc fields to lookup
   partners by email then add them to corresponding fields in mail
   composer form.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
