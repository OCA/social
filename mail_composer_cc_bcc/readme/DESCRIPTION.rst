Odoo native does not support defining a Cc field in the Mail Composer
by default; instead, it only has a unique Recipients fields, which is
confusing for a lot of end users.

This module allows to properly separate To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields
in the Mail Composer.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Add Cc and Bcc fields to mail composer form. Send only once to multiple email
  addresses.
* Add Cc and Bcc fields to company form to use them as default in mail composer
  form.
* Add Bcc field to mail template form. Use Cc and Bcc fields to lookup partners
  by email then add them to corresponding fields in mail composer form.
