When followers open their subscriptions, they will be offered the choice to
override mail settings and to force being notified about their own messages.

Note subscriptions are only editable for users of the `Technical settings`
group.

You can add defaults per message subtype for this settings in Settings /
Technical / Email / Subtypes. Here, you also have the opportunity to apply
those defaults to existing subscriptions. Note that this overrides all
customizations your users already have done.
