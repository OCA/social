In standard Odoo, receiving mail notifications is an all or nothing affair.
This module allows users to decide per followed record if they want to
receive emails or not. Further, they can choose to receive notifications about
their own messages.

You can also set defaults for this settings on the subtype in question.

Configuration
=============

When followers open their subscriptions, they will be offered the choice to
override mail settings and to force being notified about their own messages.

Note subscriptions are only editable for users of the `Technical settings`
group.

You can add defaults per message subtype for this settings in Settings /
Technical / Email / Subtypes. Here, you also have the opportunity to apply
those defaults to existing subscriptions. Note that this overrides all
customizations your users already have done.
