QWeb for email templates
========================

This module was written to allow you to write email templates in QWeb instead
of jinja2. The advantage here is that with QWeb, you can make use of
inheritance and the ``call`` statement, which allows you to reuse designs and
snippets in multiple templates, making your development process simpler.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Select `QWeb` in the field `Body templating engine`
* Select a QWeb view to be used to render the body field
* Apart from QWeb's standard variables, you also have access to ``object`` and
  ``email_template``, which are browse records of the current object and the
  email template in use, respectively.
