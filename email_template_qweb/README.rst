This module was written to allow you to write email templates in QWeb
view instead of QWeb. The advantage here is that with QWeb View, you can
make use of inheritance and the ``call`` statement, which allows you to
reuse designs and snippets in multiple templates, making your
development process simpler. Furthermore, QWeb views are easier to edit
with the integrated ACE editor.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Settings / Email Templates* and create a new template
2. Select QWeb View in the field Body templating engine
3. Select a QWeb View to be used to render the body field

Apart from QWeb View standard variables, you also have access to
``object`` and ``email_template``, which are browse records of the
current object and the email template in use, respectively.
