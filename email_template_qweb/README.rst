This module was written to allow you to write email templates in `QWeb view` instead
of QWeb. The advantage here is that with QWeb View, you can make use of
inheritance and the ``call`` statement, which allows you to reuse designs and
snippets in multiple templates, making your development process simpler.
Furthermore, QWeb views are easier to edit with the integrated ACE editor.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Select `QWeb View` in the field `Body templating engine`
#. Select a `QWeb View` to be used to render the body field
#. Apart from `QWeb View` standard variables, you also have access to ``object`` and ``email_template``, which are browse records of the current object and the email template in use, respectively.
