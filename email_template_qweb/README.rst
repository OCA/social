This module was written to allow you to write email templates in QWeb instead
of jinja2. The advantage here is that with QWeb, you can make use of
inheritance and the ``call`` statement, which allows you to reuse designs and
snippets in multiple templates, making your development process simpler. 
Furthermore, QWeb views are easier to edit with the integrated ACE editor.
