Once configured:

1.  Go to *Email Marketing \> Mailings \> Create*.
2.  Edit your mass mailing at wish, but remember to add a snippet from
    *Footers*, so people have an *Unsubscribe* link.
3.  Send it.
4.  If somebody gets unsubscribed, you will see logs about that under
    *Email Marketing \> Unsubscriptions*.
