This addon extends the unsubscription form to let you:

- Provide proof on why you are sending mass mailings to a given contact,
  as required by the GDPR in Europe.
- Handle discrete unsubscriptions from other recipients that are not a
  mailing list. On standard module, unsubscriptions from these
  recipients directly include that mail on the general blacklist.
