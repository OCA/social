==========================================================
Customizable unsubscription process on mass mailing emails
==========================================================

This addon extends the unsubscription form to let you:

- Choose which mailing lists are not cross-unsubscriptable when unsubscribing
  from a different one.
- Know why and when a contact as been unsubscribed from a mass mailing.

Configuration
=============

Unsubscription Reasons
----------------------

You can customize what reasons will be displayed to your unsubscriptors when
they are going to unsubscribe. To do it:

#. Go to *Marketing > Configuration > Unsubscription Reasons*.
#. Create / edit / remove / sort as usual.
#. If *Details required* is enabled, they will have to fill a text area to
   continue.

Usage
=====

Once configured:

#. Go to *Mass Mailing > Mailings > Mass Mailings > Create*.
#. Edit your mass mailing at wish, but remember to add a snippet from
   *Footers*, so people have an *Unsubscribe* link.
#. Send it.
#. If somebody gets unsubscribed, you will see logs about that under
   *Mass Mailing > Mailings > Unsubscriptions*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module adds a security hash for mass mailing unsubscription URLs, which
  disables insecure URLs from mass mailing messages sent before its
  installation. This can be a problem, but anyway you'd get that problem in
  Odoo 11.0, so at least this addon will be forward-compatible with it.
* This module replaces AJAX submission core implementation from the mailing
  list management form, because it is impossible to extend it. When
  https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/14386 gets merged (which upstreams most
  needed changes), this addon will need a refactoring (mostly removing
  duplicated functionality and depending on it instead of replacing it). In the
  mean time, there is a little chance that this introduces some
  incompatibilities with other addons that depend on ``website_mass_mailing``.
