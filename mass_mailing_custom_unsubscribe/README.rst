This addon extends the unsubscription form to let you:

- Choose which mailing lists are not cross-unsubscriptable when unsubscribing
  from a different one.
- Know why and when a contact has been subscribed or unsubscribed from a
  mass mailing.
- Provide proof on why you are sending mass mailings to a given contact, as
  required by the GDPR in Europe.
- Handle discrete unsubscriptions from other recipients that are not a mailing
  list. On standard module, unsubscriptions from these recipients directly
  include that mail on the general blacklist.

Configuration
=============

You can customize what reasons will be displayed to your unsubscriptors when
they are going to unsubscribe. To do it:

#. Go to *Email Marketing > Configuration > Unsubscription Reasons*.
#. Create / edit / remove / sort as usual.
#. If *Details required* is enabled, they will have to fill a text area to
   continue.

For having discrete unsubscriptions from other recipients than the mailing
lists, you need to add a glue module that adds 2 fields in the associated
model:

- `opt_out`.
- Either `email` or `email_from`.

See `mass_mailing_custom_unsubscribe_event` for an example.

Usage
=====

Once configured:

#. Go to *Email Marketing > Mailings > Create*.
#. Edit your mass mailing at wish, but remember to add a snippet from
   *Footers*, so people have an *Unsubscribe* link.
#. Send it.
#. If somebody gets unsubscribed, you will see logs about that under
   *Email Marketing > Unsubscriptions*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module replaces AJAX submission core implementation from the mailing
  list management form, because it is impossible to extend it. When this is
  fixed, this addon will need a refactoring (mostly removing
  duplicated functionality and depending on it instead of replacing it).
