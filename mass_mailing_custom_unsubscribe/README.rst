This addon extends the unsubscription form to let you:

- Choose which mailing lists are not cross-unsubscriptable when unsubscribing
  from a different one.
- Know why and when a contact has been subscribed or unsubscribed from a
  mass mailing.
- Provide proof on why you are sending mass mailings to a given contact, as
  required by the GDPR in Europe.

Configuration
=============

You can customize what reasons will be displayed to your unsubscriptors when
they are going to unsubscribe. To do it:

#. Go to *Mass Mailing > Configuration > Unsubscription Reasons*.
#. Create / edit / remove / sort as usual.
#. If *Details required* is enabled, they will have to fill a text area to
   continue.

Usage
=====

Once configured:

#. Go to *Mass Mailing > Mailings > Mass Mailings > Create*.
#. Edit your mass mailing at wish, but remember to add a snippet from
   *Footers*, so people have an *Unsubscribe* link.
#. Send it.
#. If somebody gets unsubscribed, you will see logs about that under
   *Mass Mailing > Mailings > Unsubscriptions*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* As version 11 has introduced a new relation type between mailing lists and
  contacts that has multiple usability issues that are being reworked by Odoo
  to land in version 12, this module falls back to the version 10 behaviour in
  which one contact belonged to just one list.
* This module replaces AJAX submission core implementation from the mailing
  list management form, because it is impossible to extend it. When
  https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/14386 gets merged (which upstreams most
  needed changes), this addon will need a refactoring (mostly removing
  duplicated functionality and depending on it instead of replacing it). In the
  mean time, there is a little chance that this introduces some
  incompatibilities with other addons that depend on ``website_mass_mailing``.
