Customizable unsubscribe link on mass mailing emails
====================================================

With this module you can set a custom unsubscribe link append at bottom of mass
mailing emails.


Configuration
=============

To configure unsubscribe label go to Setting > Technical > Parameters > System parameters
and add a 'mass_mailing.unsubscribe.label' parameter with html to set at bottom
of mass emailing emails. Including '%(url)s' variable where unsubscribe link

For example:

.. code:: html

  <small>You can unsubscribe <a href="%(url)s">here</a></small>


Additionally, you can disable this link if you set this parameter to 'False'

If this parameter (mass_mailing.unsubscribe.label) is not set (or set to '')
default 'Click to unsubscribe' link will appear. This default text is
translatable via Settings > Translations > Application Terms > Translated terms

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This custom html is not translatable, so as a suggestion, you can define
  the same text in several languages in several lines.

For example:

.. code:: html

  <small>[EN] You can unsubscribe <a href="%(url)s">here</a></small><br/>
  <small>[ES] Puedes darte de baja <a href="%(url)s">aqu√≠</a></small>
