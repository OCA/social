This module extends the functionality of Mail Module to allow users to
receive each mail sent by Odoo, in BCC mode.

Use Case
--------

This feature can be usefull for users:

* to be sure the mail was sent because Odoo send mail depending of
  some partner parameters

* to have the whole conversation if the partner writes an answer and if
  mailbox manages thread by object

* to be sure smtp server works
