To configure this module, you need to:

Go to Settings -> Technical -> Email -> Mail Reference Mentions.
There you can create combinations of delimiters and models.
For example if you want the following:

"When I press the character # on the chatter shown on the Customer form, I
want to see records of their Sales Orders"

you will have to create a new Mail Reference Mention that will have as
delimiter the character #, then on the field Shown At you set the model
Customers and on the field Shows you set the model Sales
