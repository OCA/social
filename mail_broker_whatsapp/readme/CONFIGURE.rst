If you create a test Business Account, passwords will change every 24 hours.

In order to make the webhook accessible, the system must be public.

Configure the broker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have created the Meta App, you need to add the broker and webhook.
In order to make it you must follow this steps:

*  Access `Settings > Emails > Mail Broker`
*  Create a Broker of type `WhatsApp`

  *  Use the Meta App authentication key as `Token` field
  *  Use the Meta App Phone Number ID as `Whatsapp from Phone` field
  *  Write your own `Webhook key`
  *  Use the Application Secret Key on `Whatsapp Security Key`. It will be used in order to validate the data
  *  Press the `Integrate Webhook Key`. In this case, it will not integrate it, we need to make it manually
  *  Copy the webhook URL

* Access `Facebook Apps website <https://developers.facebook.com/apps/>`_
* Access your App then `Whatsapp > Configuration`
* Create your webhook using your URL and put the Whatsapp Security Key as validation Key
* Administer the Webhook and activate the messages webhook
