have to be sent notifications through the chatter. The models in which
these rules have to be applied can also be selected.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module you need to:

-  Go to Settings > Technical > Auto Subscribe Mute
-  Create a new instance or edit an exiting one. The following fields
   are available:

   -  **Name**. The name of the rule.
   -  **Model**. Model in which the rule is applied. Only models with a
      user_id field can be selected.
   -  **Users**. List of users which the rule will be applied to. The
      users in this field will be autosubscribed to the document when
      they are set in the user_id field but only with the "Muted"
      subtype, which notifies nothing. Note that this rule will not be
      applied when the user in the list set itself in the user_id field,
      as the subscription in this case depends on the creation of the
      document, not the autosubscription.
   -  **Groups**. List of groups which the rule will be applied to. The
      users that belong to the groups in this field will be
      autosubscribed to the document when they are set in the user_id
      field but only with the "Muted" subtype, which notifies nothing.
      Note that this rule will not be applied when a user in any of the
      groups in the list set itself in the user_id field, as the
      subscription in this case depends on the creation of the document,
      not the autosubscription.
   -  **Notes**. Text field.

Usage
=====

In case a user that has been automatically applied the "Mute" message
subtype in a subscription through one of the rules provided in this
module needs to be sent notifications in a specific document, just edit
the subscription and select the subtypes for which the user has to be
sent notifications.
