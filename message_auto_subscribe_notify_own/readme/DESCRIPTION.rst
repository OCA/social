With this module you will receive a notification when you assign yourself
to an object that has a responsible user, like the salesperson in
leads/opportunities.

In general Odoo will notify other users in this situation, but not the own
user who has performed the action.

But in certain situations it is better that you receive this notification, as
a reminder sent to your mailbox that you are now responsible for that object.
