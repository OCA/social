To set up new teams:

#. Go to *Settings / Activate developer mode*
#. Go to *Settings / Technical / Email / Activity Teams*
#. Create a new Team and assign (optionally) the models in which it will
   be used, and the members of the team.

You can also assign a user to Activity teams going to
*Settings / Users & Companies / Users*, and in the *Preferences* tab, field
Activity Teams.

When you create a new activity the application will propose the user's
assigned team.

You can report on the activities assigned to a team going to
*Dashboards / Activities*, and then filter by a specific team or group by
teams.
