This module was written to allow users to drag&drop emails from their desktop to Odoo.

It supports as well RFC822 .eml files as Outlook .msg (those only if `an extra library <https://github.com/mattgwwalker/msg-extractor>`_ is installed) files.

When the mail is dropped to an odoo record, it will automatically send a notification
of that new message that has been added to all the existing followers. It is possible
to disable this notification.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. save your emails on the desktop / somewhere in the file system
#. drag them to your browser, and drop them on the chatter of the record you want to attach your email to

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* most mail clients won't allow you to drag mails directly from the mail client, you'll need some plugin for that
* for corporate environments, it might be feasible to support imap URLs and get the mail in question on the server side
