This module integrates mail_tracking events with Mailgun webhooks.

Mailgun (https://www.mailgun.com/) is a service that provides an e-mail
sending infrastructure through an SMTP server or via API. You can also
query that API for seeing statistics of your sent e-mails, or provide
hooks that processes the status changes in real time, which is the
function used here.
