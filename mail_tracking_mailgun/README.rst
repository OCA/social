This module integrates mail_tracking events with Mailgun webhooks.

Mailgun (https://www.mailgun.com/) is a service that provides an e-mail
sending infrastructure through an SMTP server or via API. You can also
query that API for seeing statistics of your sent e-mails, or provide
hooks that processes the status changes in real time, which is the
function used here.

Installation
============

If you're using a multi-database installation (with or without dbfilter option)
where /web/databse/selector returns a list of more than one database, then
you need to add ``mail_tracking_mailgun`` addon to wide load addons list
(by default, only ``web`` addon), setting ``--load`` option.

Example: ``--load=web,mail_tracking,mail_tracking_mailgun``

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to Mailgun, create an account and validate your sending domain.
#. Go back to Odoo.
#. Go to *Settings > General Settings > Discuss > Enable mail tracking with Mailgun*.
#. Fill all the values. The only one required is the API key.
#. Optionally click *Unregister Mailgun webhooks* and accept.
#. Click *Register Mailgun webhooks*.

You can also config partner email autocheck with this system parameter:

- `mailgun.auto_check_partner_email`: Set it to True.

Usage
=====

In your mail tracking status screens (explained on module *mail_tracking*), you
will see a more accurate information, like the 'Received' or 'Bounced' status,
which are not usually detected by normal SMTP servers.

It's also possible to make some checks to the partner's email addresses against
the Mailgun API:

- Check if the partner's email is in Mailgun's bounced list.
- Check the validity of the partner's mailbox.
- Force the partner's email into Mailgun's bounced list or delete from it.

It's also possible to manually check a message mailgun tracking when the webhook
couldn't be captured. For that, go to that message tracking form, press the
button *Check Mailgun*. It's important to note that tracking events have quite a
short lifespan, so after 24h they won't be recoverable.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* There's no support for more than one Mailgun mail server.

* Automate more webhook registration. It would be nice to not have to click the
  "Unregister Mailgun webhooks" and "Register Mailgun webhooks" when setting up
  Mailgun in Odoo. However, it doesn't come without its `conceptual complexities
  <https://github.com/OCA/social/pull/787#discussion_r734275262>`__.
