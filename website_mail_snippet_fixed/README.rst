==============================================
Fixed-Width Layout Snippets for Writing Emails
==============================================

This module extends the functionality of the website mail designer with new
snippets with a fixed-width layout that works fine across any mail client,
including MS Outlook.

Installation
============

This module is prepared to be compatible with module ``website_mail_bg_color``.
If you install it, you will be able to change snippets' background colors, but
it is not required.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Install any module that makes use of the website mail designer, such as
   ``mass_mailing``.
#. Edit an email with the website mail designer.
#. You have a new collection of snippets under *Fixed 560px Width* section.
   Use them as usual.

If you choose the *Horizontal Separator* snippet, you will be able to set its
height too. For that, you will have to aim carefully to click inside the green
line, and then use the option that will float above it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Snippet code is ugly, but that's because mail client HTML engines usually
  lack many of the modern CSS and HTML features. I hope we will be able to
  improve this as mail clients keep improving.
* To set the *Horizontal Separator* height, you have to click inside it, which
  will insert a ``<br type="_moz"/>`` in Firefox, that will make it seem like
  its height is at least like a caret, even if you set a lower value. Do not
  worry, it goes away when you press *Save*.
