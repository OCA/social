Go to a partner. Next to the partner's email address you will see
a plus symbol. Once you press it the partner's email address will be
blacklisted and then a ban will appear. If you click that ban the email address
will be removed from the blacklist.

You can also filter for the Blacklist attribute, to see all the partner's that
their email has been added to the blacklist.

To add or remove emails to the blacklist in mass, go to the partners list view and select
the records of partners that must be added or removed from the blacklist. Press action,
and then "Add To Blacklist" or "Remove From Blacklist". For the remove case, a wizard will
open where you can specify the reason of the removal.
