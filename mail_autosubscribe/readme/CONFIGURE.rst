Go to Configuration > Technical > Automation > Autosubscribe Models and configure
the models for which you want the feature to work.

Then, on each partner, you can check the company documents subscriptions in the
field `In copy of`.

This feature can be disabled on specific templates, if required, by disabling the
Autosubscribe followers field.
