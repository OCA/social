This module was written to mark Odoo's emails as being autogenerated
according to `RFC 3834 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3834>`__, section
5. This allows receiving mail servers to act accordingly by for example
not sending a vacation autoreply.

On the receiving side, this module drops all notifications for
autogenerated incoming e-mails.

The combination of both avoids possible mail loops with misconfigured or
broken email servers on the opposite side.

Usage
=====

There's nothing the user has to do. Developers can set the context flag
``mail_autogenerated_header_disable`` in calls to ``send_email`` in
order to suppress adding any headers at all, and override
``_message_route_process_autoreply`` to fine tune dropping autogenerated
mails per model.
