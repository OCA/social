=====================
Autogenerated headers
=====================

This module was written to mark Odoo's emails as being autogenerated according to `RFC 3834 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3834>`_, section 5. This allows receiving mail servers to act accordingly by for example not sending a vacation autoreply.

On the receiving side, this module drops all autogenerated incoming e-mails.

The combination of both avoids possible mail loops with misconfigured or broken email servers on the opposite side.

Usage
=====

There's nothing the user has to do. Developers can set the context flag ``mail_autogenerated_header_disable`` in calls to ``send_email`` in order to suppress adding any headers at all, and override ``_message_route_drop_autoreply`` to fine tune dropping autogenerated mails per model.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* a configuration of this per message subtype would be nice
