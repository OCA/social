This module was written to mark Odoo's emails as being autogenerated
according to [RFC 3834](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3834), section 5.
This allows receiving mail servers to act accordingly by for example not
sending a vacation autoreply.

On the receiving side, this module drops all notifications for
autogenerated incoming e-mails.

The combination of both avoids possible mail loops with misconfigured or
broken email servers on the opposite side.
