This module was written to mark Odoo's emails as being autogenerated according to `RFC 3834 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3834>`_, section 5. This allows receiving mail servers to act accordingly by for example not sending a vacation autoreply.

On the receiving side, this module drops all notifications for autogenerated incoming e-mails.

The combination of both avoids possible mail loops with misconfigured or broken email servers on the opposite side.
