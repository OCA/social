This module asks for confirmation when 'Send' button in the message composer of the
chatter is pressed, to reduce the chances of accidentally sending an internal message
to the external followers.

Limitation
~~~~~~~~~~

As of now, this module does not change the behavior of the full composer (i.e. no confirmation will be requested),
which shows the recipients and therefore the extra confirmation step may not be as necessary
as in the simple composer.
