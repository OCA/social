========================
Mail message name search
========================

This module adds the capability to search for mail messages by subject or
body of the message. This will be useful in models that make intense use of
messages, like project issues or helpdesk tickets.

This module will add dynamically the message_ids to the search view of 
any model that inherits from the mail.thread and will incorporate the
capability to search for content in the mail messages.


Installation
============

This module depends on the module 'base_search_fuzzy' to ensure that
searches on emails are based on indexes. Please read carefully the install
instructions https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/blob/8.0/base_search_fuzzy/README.rst

This module installs by default the indexes that are required to
perform the searches on mail messages.


Configuration
=============

No configuration is needed.

Usage
=====

A project issue or helpdesk ticket can contain tens of mails associated,
based on the conversations that the person responsible for the ticket
maintains with the person that raised the issue. One need to search
in mail messages, as much as he/she needs to search in their mail for
past conversations. So this module will be useful for the user to search
messages by subject or body.
