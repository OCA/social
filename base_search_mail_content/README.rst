This module adds the capability to find on any object (e.g. project
issues or helpdesk ticket) based on the conversation threads associated
to them.

This will be useful in models that make intense use of messages, like
project issues or helpdesk tickets.

A project issue or helpdesk ticket can contain tens of mails or notes
associated, based on the feedback that the person responsible for the
ticket maintains, including conversations with the person that raised
the issue.

A user may often want to find issues or tickets, based on the past
conversations that were recorded, as much as he or she needs to search
in their mail for past conversations.

This module will add dynamically a field 'message_content' to the search
view of any model that inherits from the mail.thread.

The current search capabilities include searching into the subject,
body, email from, reply to and record name.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Installation
============

This module creates the GIN (trigram) indexes for these fields of
mail.message: subject, body, record_name, email_from, reply_to.

Usage
=====

Go to any model that contains a chatter (e.g. Contacts, ...). Search for
content in field 'Message Content'.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module restricts the message_content search functionality to
   internal users only, addressing the issue faced by project
   collaborators (portal users) as described in
   https://github.com/OCA/social/issues/1204. Consequently, portal users
   no longer have the ability to search within mail content.
