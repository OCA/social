This module depends on the module 'base_search_fuzzy' to ensure that
searches on emails are based on indexes. Please read carefully the
`install instructions <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/blob/11.0/base_search_fuzzy>`_.

This module installs by default the indexes that are required to
perform the searches on mail messages.
