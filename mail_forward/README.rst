===============
Message forward
===============

This module was written to extend the functionality of mails to support
forwarding them to another contact or database object.

* **To another object of the database:** All its followers are notified
  according to their settings.

* **To other contacts:** They recieve the forwarded message according to the
  usual notification rules of Odoo.

Configuration
=============

When installed, this module allows forwarding to a limited selection of
database models, that will get automatically updated when you install other
modules.

This list can be customized by a user that has *Technical Features* permission.
To do it:

* Go to *Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Referenceable Models*.

* Any model there with *Mail forward target* enabled will appear in the list of
  models that can get forwarded messages.

  * If you want to *remove* a model from the list, it's usually better to just
    *disable* its check box instead of deleting it, because that record might
    be used by other modules.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to any view that has a message thread.
* Press *Forward* (the button with a curved arrow pointing to the right).
* Modify the subject if you wish.
* If you want to forward the message to an *object*, choose it from the
  selector.
* If you want to forward the message to some partner(s), add them in the
  selector.
* Modify the message if you want.
* Add attachments if you want.
* If the message contains attachments, you can turn on the *Move attachments*
  option, and those will get attached to the new object.

  You will need to install the *document* module and have at least *User*
  permissions for *Knowledge* to see the effect.

**NOTE**

Internally, forwarded messages are modified copies of
original ones, but attachments are references to the exact originals to
avoid duplicating disk space. Keep that in mind when managing permissions.
