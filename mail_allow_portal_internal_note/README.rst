This feature allows for some Portal users to see internal messages.

This can be useful, for example, for external representatives
that work together with internal users, and need to collaborate with them.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

In the User form, Portal Users have available two checkboxes:

- "See own company Internal Messages"
- "See other company Internal Messages"

These allow the Portal User to see
the internal messages in documents related to his parent company, or
the internal messages in documents related to other companies
that are not his parent company, or both.
