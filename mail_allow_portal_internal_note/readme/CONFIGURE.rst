In the User form, Portal Users have available two checkboxes:

- "See own company Internal Messages"
- "See other company Internal Messages"

These allow the Portal User to see
the internal messages in documents related to his parent company, or
the internal messages in documents related to other companies
that are not his parent company, or both.
