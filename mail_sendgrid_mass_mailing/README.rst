SendGrid for mass mailing
=========================

Links mass mailing and mail statistics objects with Sendgrid.
Note that the mass mailing campaign will be sent with Sendgrid transactional
e-emails (not to mix up with Sendgrid marketing campaigns)

Installation
============

This addon will be automatically installed when 'mail_sendgrid' and
'mass_mailing' are both installed.

Note this module is not compatible with the v6 versions of the sendgrid library.

Configuration
=============
None

Usage
=====

From mass mailing, you can use Sendgrid templates.

#. If you select a Sendgrid template, the campaign will be sent through
   Sendgrid. Otherwise it will use what you set in your system preference
   (see module sendgrid).
#. You can force usage of a language for the template.
