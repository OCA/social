Odoo will add a default email layout on most commercial communications.

The email layout is a ``QWeb`` view that ends up wrapping the message body
when sending an email. It usually displays the related document reference,
the company logo, and a small footer saying "Powered by Odoo".

There are notably two main layouts used in Odoo, and the user can't control when
they're used, as it's hardcoded into the different applications.

* ``mail.mail_notification_light``
* ``mail.mail_notification_paynow``

This module allows to force a specific layout for a given ``email.template``,
effectively overwritting the one hardcoded by Odoo.

This allows you to fully customize the way Odoo emails are rendered and sent
to your customers.

Configuration
=============

# Go to Configuration > Technical > Emails > Templates
# Open the desired ``email.template`` record.
# In Advanced Parameters tab, find the Force Layout field.

You can leave it empty to use the default email layout (chosen by Odoo).
You can force a custom email layout of your own.
You can use the *Mail: No-Layout notification template* to prevent Odoo
from adding a layout.

To configure a custom layout of your own, some technical knowledge is needed.
You can see how the existing layouts are defined for details or inspiration:

* ``mail.mail_notification_light``
* ``mail.mail_notification_paynow``
* ``mail.mail_notification_borders``
