This module extends the functionality of mass mailing lists to disable
duplicate entries in list names and contact emails per list.

This way you will avoid sending the same message more than once to the same
contact when selecting a mailing list, and you will avoid conflicts when
importing contacts to a list that has a duplicated name.
