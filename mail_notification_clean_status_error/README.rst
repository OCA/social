Delete email notifications in error.

The scheduled action *Notification: Delete Notifications older than 6 Month*
provided by Odoo is responsible to delete notifications that have been sent
successfully.

However, it doesn't delete the notifications that could not be sent, and their
number could keep growing over time, impacting the performance of some queries
related to the chatter.

This module extends the scheduled action of Odoo to also delete such notifications.
