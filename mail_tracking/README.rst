=============
Mail tracking
=============

This module shows email notification tracking status for any messages in
mail thread (chatter). Each notified partner will have an intuitive icon just
right to his name.


Installation
============

If you're using a multi-database installation (with or without dbfilter option)
where /web/databse/selector returns a list of more than one database, then
you need to add ``mail_tracking`` addon to wide load addons list
(by default, only ``web`` addon), setting ``--load`` option.
For example, ``--load=web,mail_tracking``


Usage
=====

When user sends a message in mail_thread (chatter), for instance in partner
form, then an email tracking is created for each email notification. Then a
status icon will appear just right to name of notified partner.

These are all available status icons:

.. |delivered| image:: mail_tracking/static/src/img/delivered.png
   :width: 15px
