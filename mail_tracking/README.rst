This module shows email notification tracking status for any messages in
mail thread (chatter). Each notified partner will have an intuitive icon
just right to his name.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::

Installation
============

If you're using a multi-database installation (with or without dbfilter
option) where /web/databse/selector returns a list of more than one
database, then you need to add ``mail_tracking`` addon to wide load
addons list (by default, only ``web`` addon), setting ``--load`` option.
For example, ``--load=web,mail,mail_tracking``

Configuration
=============

As there can be scenarios where sending a tracking img in the email body
is not desired, there is a global system parameter
"mail_tracking.tracking_img_disabled" that can be set to True to remove
the tracking img from all outgoing emails. Note that the **Opened**
status will not be available in this case.

Usage
=====

When user sends a message in mail_thread (chatter), for instance in
partner form, then an email tracking is created for each email
notification. Then a status icon will appear just right to name of
notified partner.

These are all available status icons:

|unknown| **Unknown**: No email tracking info available. Maybe this
notified partner has 'Receive Inbox Notifications by Email' == 'Never'

|waiting| **Waiting**: Waiting to be sent

|error| **Error**: Error while sending

|sent| **Sent**: Sent to SMTP server configured

|delivered| **Delivered**: Delivered to final MX server

|opened| **Opened**: Opened by partner

|cc| **Cc**: It's a Carbon-Copy recipient. Can't know the status so is
'Unknown'

|noemail| **No Email**: The partner doesn't have a defined email

|anonuser| **No Partner**: The recipient doesn't have a defined partner

If you want to see all tracking emails and events you can go to

-  Settings > Technical > Email > Tracking emails
-  Settings > Technical > Email > Tracking events

When the message generates an 'error' status, it will apear on discuss
'Failed' channel. Any view with chatter can show the failed messages
too.

You can use "Failed sent messages" filter present in all views to show
records with messages in failed status and that needs an user action.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Integrate with the core ``mail.notification`` model as it overlaps
   with what the ``mail.tracking`` model does. We could add the existing
   features on top of that model and save lots of code lines.
