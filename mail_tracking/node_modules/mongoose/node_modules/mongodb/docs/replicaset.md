Replicasets
===========

## Introduction

Replica sets is the asynchronous master/slave replication added to Mongodb that takes care off all the failover and recovery for the member nodes. According to the mongodb documentation a replicaset is

  * Two or more nodes that are copies of each other
  * Automatic assignment of a primary(master) node if none is available
  * Drivers that automatically detect the new master and send writes to it
  
More information at [Replicasets](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Sets)

## Driver usage

To create a new replicaset follow the instructions on the mongodb site to setup the config and the replicaset instances. Then using the driver.

    var replSet = new ReplSetServers( [ 
        new Server( 127.0.0.1, 30000, { auto_reconnect: true } ),
        new Server( 127.0.0.1, 30001, { auto_reconnect: true } ),
        new Server( 127.0.0.1, 30002, { auto_reconnect: true } )
      ], 
      {rs_name:RS.name}
    );

    var db = new Db('integration_test_', replSet);
    db.open(function(err, p_db) {
      // Do you app stuff :)
    })

The ReplSetSrvers object has the following parameters

    var replSet = new ReplSetSrvers(servers, options)
    
Where

  * `servers` is an array of `Server` objects
  * `options` can contain the following options
    * `rs_name` is the name of the replicaset you configured when you started the server, you can have multiple replicasets running on your servers.
    * `read_secondary` set's the driver to read from secondary servers (slaves) instead of only from the primary(master) server.
	* `socketOptions` - a collection of pr socket settings
		* `timeout` = set seconds before connection times out `default:0`
		* `noDelay` = Disables the Nagle algorithm `default:true`
		* `keepAlive` = Set if keepAlive is used `default:0`, which means no keepAlive, set higher than 0 for keepAlive
		* `encoding` = ['ascii', 'utf8', or 'base64'] `default:null`
