ACCOMPLISHED jan 4 - 2011
+ Chase down potential memory leak in findAndModify
+ Check compatibility for gridFS between python and js
+ Ensure Gridfs speed is comparable to other solutions

0.9.7.4-dev
- Amortize documents (only deserialize when accessed)
- Mongo tests to handle special Mongos situations
- If a secondary server disappears don't kill the driver connection
- Check for new servers coming online (a new secondary server etc)
- http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/api/pymongo/index.html#pymongo.ReadPreference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Allow secondary read with no master 
* Add lowest response time selection of read server for replicaset using a selectable strategy. First one being using the ping command response time
* Allow execution of multiple commands against the same server connection when having a connection pool
* Implement tag support for replicasets
* Change bson c++ parser to use js objects instead of native c++ objects
* Whole stack benchmark with profiling to locate where the driver spends time
* Change bson c++ parser to be stackless to look at performance difference
